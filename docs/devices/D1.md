# Ubisys D1

| Model | D1  |
| Vendor  | Ubisys  |
| Description | Universal dimmer D1 |
| Supports | on/off, brightness, power measurement |
| Picture | ![Ubisys D1](../images/devices/D1.jpg) |

## Notes


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.

### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use only one momentary switch instead of two) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"

    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"

    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
